  <!-- 🌸 Lesson 1 -->
  <section class="lesson-section">
    <h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to CSS</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), the language used to style and design webpages. It defines how HTML elements are displayed, making it possible to create layouts, colors, and fonts that improve the look and feel of a website. CSS allows one stylesheet to control the design of multiple web pages, saving time and effort. It also separates the structure (HTML) from style, improving consistency, accessibility, and page performance. 
        I also learned about the three layers of a webpage. The Content Layer, which defines the text, images, and other elements using HTML. The Presentation Layer, which defines how content is displayed using CSS. Lastly, the Behavior Layer, which defines how the page reacts to user interaction, often using JavaScript.
        <strong> <i> Overall, CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. </i></strong>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p> In this lesson, I learned that CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to describe how HTML elements are displayed on a webpage. It separates content (HTML) from design (CSS), making pages easier to manage and more visually consistent. 
        There are 3 types of CSS style sheets: Inline, Internal/Embedded, and External. Inline CSS is applied directly to HTML elements using the "style" attribute. Internal CSS is defined within a &lt;style&lt;  tag in the HTML document's &lt;head&lt; section. External CSS is stored in separate .css files and linked to HTML documents using the &lt;link&lt; tag.
        Overall, using CSS enhances the appearance and usability of websites while simplifying maintenance and updates.

    <h2>Lesson 3: Display, Div, and Span Tag</h2>
    <div class="photo-row">

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content-box">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p> In this lesson, I learned about how CSS controls how elements are displayed using the display property. Elements can be block-level or inline, which determine how they appear on a webpage. I also learned that div tags are used to group sections and are block-level, while span tags are used for styling small inline parts of text.
        In summary, understanding display properties and the use of div and span tags is super important for structuring and styling web content effectively.

    <h2>Lesson 4: CSS Rules and Classes</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="content-box">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned about CSS rules. CSS rules consist of selectors and declarations that determine how elements appear on a webpage. I also learned how to use classes to apply style to the specified elements. I also learned about grouping selectors, which is helpful for applying the same style to multiple elements efficiently. 
        Overall, understanding and being able to apply CSS rules and classes is essential for creating a good web design and for good styling.

    <h2>Lesson 5: CSS Selectors</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="content-box">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned that CSS selectors are the foundation of styling in web design. The <strong>element selector</strong> targets all occurrences of a specific tag, while the <strong>ID selector</strong> (using `#`) styles a unique element. The <strong>class selector</strong> (using `.`) applies styles to multiple elements that share the same class. The <strong>universal selector</strong> (`*`) styles all elements at once, while <strong>group selectors</strong> combine several elements to share one style. Lastly, the <strong>attribute selector</strong> targets elements based on specific attributes or their values.
        Overall, knowing how to these selectors and fully understanding them is crucial for good web design.

    <h2>Lesson 6: Pseudo-Classes and Dimensions</h2>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content-box">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p> In this lesson, I learned that CSS can be used to manage dimensions such as visibility, width or height of HTML elements. I also learned that Pseudo-classes are defined by a colon and are not user-defined. Specific pseudo-classes can be used on specific HTML elements only. The anchor element has four pseudo-classes: link, visited, hover and active. Each one affects thebehavior of the anchor element. 
        Overall, understanding pseudo-classes and dimensions is important for creating interactive and visually appealing web pages.
