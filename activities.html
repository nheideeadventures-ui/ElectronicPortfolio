        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
Buwan ng Wika celebrates our national language, encouraging students to value their roots as Filipinos. It includes many activities and contests, making sure all students are heavily involved and participate in Buwan ng Wika. I learned to appreciate the beauty of our Filipino language more deeply. Buwan ng Wika reminded me of how amazing our Filipino language and culture really is.
I can use what I learned by speaking Filipino more fluently and understanding the language more. I will make sure to promote our Filipino culture in school activities and in my everyday life.
I was even able to participate because everyone had to present the monologue Luha by Rufino Alejandro for a performance task in Filipino. I was voted by my classmates to represent our class for the competition where I had to perform the monologue again agaist the other grade 9 represntatives.
In my opinion, Buwan ng Wika is so important because helps us strengthen our sense of nationalism, reminds us of the beauty of our own tagalog language, and helps us learn more about our filipino culture.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> Intrams was a very fun activity to participate in. It gives students opportunities to showcase their athletic skills and observe good sportsmanship at all times. It allows us to join various games such as vollyball, laro ng lahi, and many others, giving students a lot of opportunities to participate in the event.
          Intrams reminded me how fun it is to play sports with teammates as well as how exciting it is to watch the games of other players and root for my team to win. I can use the skills I developed by joining the intrams games as well as the good sportsmanship I have developed and apply it in my everyday life. I was able to 
        participate by joining sack race and winning first place 🏅 with my teammates. Intrams is such a fun experience for students and a core memory for our student lives. It helps us develop sportsmanship, perseverance, and teamwork. </p>

        <p>The most important thing I learned from AP Month is the value of understanding our country’s history and culture. Through the different activities, I was reminded of how important it is to appreciate our heritage and to stay informed about the issues in our society. 
          I actively participated in the event by listening to the seminar held and answering the quiz with my group. If I were to teach this topic to a classmate, I would explain that AP month helps helps us understand history so we can make better decisions for the future. 
          This event is important because it strengthens our love for our country and reminds us that being a good citizen starts with knowing our roots.</p>

        <p>The most important thing I learned from Science Month is that science is not just about experiments, it’s about curiosity, discovery, and understanding how the world works. I participated by creating a poster for science month and answering a quizbee elimination test. 
          In real life, I can apply what I learned by being more observant and thinking critically about everyday problems. If I were to teach this to a classmate, I would explain that science encourages us to ask “why” and “how,” helping us find solutions to real-life challenges.

I know how much patience, love, and sacrifice teachers give just to help us learn, and Teachers’ Day gave us students the opportunity to give back to our teachers.
          I participated by helping plan the flow of the program, creating the canva presentation we used that day, joining the games prepared, making handwritten letters for the teachers, and performing an intermission song dedicated to the teachers that really do their best to teach us and help us. If I were to explain this to a classmate, I would say that Teachers’ Day is about showing our gratitude and respect to our beloved teachers. 
          This event is important because it reminds us to never take our teachers for granted and allows us to give back to our teachers for all they do for us as they play a huge role in shaping our future.</p>
