      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> My name is Nicole Heidee M. Kierulf, and I turned 14 on May 28. I consider myself a loving person because the main things God wants us to do is to love God and love all people. My hobbies are singing, acting, and writing, and playing sports. I like a lot of things, but when I think of my favorites, I think about God, my friends, and just being with the people I love. 
        I dedicate my whole life and everything I do to God because He is the one who loves me unconditionally and will be there for me at all times. I want to live my life for Him and make sure that everything I do brings glory to His name.

      <h2>Friends</h2>
      <p> My friends are the people that bring fun to my life and are my motivation to go to school. I believe that my friends right now are the people I've prayed for God to put in my life. I love them with my whole heart and I will forever treasure the relationship I have with each and every one of them. I hope our friendship lasts forever, because there's no other people I'd rather grow up with and be with for the rest of our lives.</p>

I love that I can say my family are good, God loving people and that everything we do should always be for Jesus and to glorify His name. </p>
